In the \"cloud\" you are able to share your code with other people and you can push and pull other code freely.  \r\n**Github Requires Git**\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Initial Setup\r\nTo making a git hub account you have to go to github.com, go to the green button on the top right to sign up. You will have to make a username and password and put in a email address for secruity reasons. After you finish signing up on github, go to your email to verif that your account has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\nThere are multiple steps needed to be taken to create a repo. \r\n1. Create a local repo on your computer\r\n2. Initialize git \r\n3. Create a file\r\n4. Make changes to the file\r\n5. Add the file that you changed\r\n6. Commit the change\r\n7. Push the change\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands  \r\nThere are many commands coders use when working on their project/repository.  \r\nSuch exapmles consist of:  \r\n* `git status` is when you ask the computer what is going on with your code. Is the last command I used working correcctly, or what is the problem with my code currently?  \r\n* `git add` is when you add a file(s) to the \"stage\". you can use `git add <file name>` which adds a single file that you changed or `git  add .` which adds all files that you changed.  \r\n* `git commit` is where to save everything on the stage as is. You can add a message with the saving of all the work by using -m like `git commit -m \"your message\"`.  \r\n* `git push` is when you push your local repo to your remote repo.",
