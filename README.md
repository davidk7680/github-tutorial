## Git vs. GitHub
**Git** is the _local_ part of your code.
Your code is being held only on your personal computer or wherever you are coding.  
**Git Does Not Require Github**  

**Github** is the "cloud" or the _remote_ version of where your code is being held. In the "cloud" you are able to share your code with other people and you can push and pull other code freely.

## Workflow & Commands  
There are many commands coders use when working on their project/repository.  
Such exapmles consist of:  
`git status` is when you ask the computer what is going on with your code. Is the last command I used working correcctly, or what is the problem with my code currently?  
`git add` is when you add a file(s) to the "stage". you can use `git add <file name>` which adds a single file that you changed or `git  add .` which adds all files that you changed.  
`git commit` is where to save everything on the stage as is. You can add a message with the saving of all the work by using -m like `git commit -m "your message"`.  
`git push` is when you push your local repo to your remote repo.
